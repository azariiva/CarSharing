<h2>Size of parts</h2>
<p>A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard. </p><p>If the size of the part is <b>larger</b>, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.<br>If the size of the part is
<b>smaller</b>, it is removed as a reject, and the detector prints the number -1.<br>If
the part is <b>perfect</b>, it is sent to the box with products, 
















that are ready to ship, 



and the
detector prints 0.</p><p>Write a program, which
takes the number 

of parts <b><i>n</i></b> as input,

<span> and then the
sequence of detector prints. The program should output numbers in a single line
containing the number of parts ready to be shipped, the number of parts to be
fixed, and the number of rejects.</span></p>
